# Parity bit algorithm in C
This algorithm uses Bitwise Operators in C to check if the amount of 1-bits in a number (up to 7 bits in size, i.e., lesser than 128) is even. If true, no changes are made to the number; else, it changes the 8th bit of the number to a 1-bit. It prints the binary form of number before this, and then again after if changes are made to the 8th bit. On both cases, it displays the number being printed as a binary.

## How to run it

Type ``./par (number)`` in the Command Line.
